# Review-management-System
This is a full-stack web application designed to allow users to submit, edit, and delete their reviews. 
Using ReactJS as frontend and JavaSpringBoot as backend, this project was built.
Now to add dependencies, Maven was used.
This project also helps businesses or platforms gather or manage the structured feedback from users to improve services.
As this is a group project, my contribution to this project was to connect the frontend and the backend by sending POST,GET requests
